 ### Brief Description 

Our system is designed as an event booking system, the users can easily book an event using the system. The system allows the users to
insert Event name as Title and the organizer name as well as choosing the Date, Month and the respective venue which they would like to book for the event. The users can keep adding events into the system as it is in a loop, when the user is satisfied with booking events, they can easily exit the system when the system asks whether to continue or exit. 

Our system contains the following features:
1. Distinguish between months that have 31 days and 30 days. Shows an error if the date chosen is more than the range.
2. Each event is a full day event. No event cannot be held on the same day in the same venue, users can book a different venue for the same day but booking the same venue who result in an error.
